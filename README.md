```python
from yolo_overlay.detection import DetectionBox

# Example validation
detection_box = DetectionBox(
    id=1,
    x=100,
    y=150,
    width=200,
    height=250,
    color=0x00FF00FF,  # Example COLORREF
    label=b"Person\x00" + b'\x00' * 49,
    lastSeen=123456789,
    paused=0
)

# Verify fields
assert detection_box.id == 1
assert detection_box.label.startswith(b"Person")
```

#### 5. **Use Breakpoints in C Code**

If you have access to the C source code:
